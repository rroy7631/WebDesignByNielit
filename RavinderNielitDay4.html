            Lakshmibai, the Rani of Jhansi (About this soundpronunciation (help·info); 19 November 1828 – 18 June
            1858),[1][2] was an Indian queen of the Maratha princely state of Jhansi in North India currently present in
            Jhansi district in Uttar Pradesh, India.[3] She was one of the leading figures of the Indian Rebellion of 1857
            and became a symbol of resistance to the British Raj for Indian nationalists. <br><br>
            History of Jhansi, 1842 - May 1857
            Manikarnika was married to the Maharaja of Jhansi, Gangadhar Rao Newalkar, in May 1842[4][18] and was afterwards
            called Lakshmibai (or Laxmibai) in honour of the Hindu goddess Lakshmi and according to the Maharashtrian
            tradition of women being given a new name after marriage. In September 1851, she gave birth to a boy, later
            named Damodar Rao, who died four months after birth. The Maharaja adopted a child called Anand Rao, the son of
            Gangadhar Rao's cousin, who was renamed Damodar Rao, on the day before the Maharaja died. The adoption was in
            the presence of the British political officer who was given a letter from the Maharaja instructing that the
            child be treated with respect and that the government of Jhansi should be given to his widow for her lifetime.

            After the death of the Maharaja in November 1853, because Damodar Rao (born Anand Rao) was an adopted son, the
            British East India Company, under Governor-General Lord Dalhousie, applied the Doctrine of Lapse, rejecting
            Damodar Rao's claim to the throne and annexing the state to its territories. When she was informed of this she
            cried out "Main apni Jhansi nahi doongi" (I shall not surrender my Jhansi). In March 1854, Rani Lakshmibai was
            given an annual pension of Rs. 60,000 and ordered to leave the palace and the fort.[19][20]

            According to Vishnu Bhatt Godse the Rani would exercise at weightlifting, wrestling and steeplechasing before
            breakfast. An intelligent and simply-dressed woman, she ruled in a business-like manner.[21]<br><br>

            Indian Rebellion of 1857
            Beginning of the Rebellion
            On 10 May 1857 the Indian Rebellion started in Meerut. When news of the fighting reached Jhansi, the Rani asked
            the British political officer, Captain Alexander Skene, for permission to raise a body of armed men for her own
            protection; Skene agreed to this.[22] The city was relatively calm in the midst of the regional unrest, but the
            Rani conducted a Haldi Kumkum ceremony with pomp in front of all the women of Jhansi to provide assurance to her
            subjects, in the summer of 1857 and to convince them that the British were cowards and not to be afraid of
            them.[23][24]

            Until this point, Lakshmibai was reluctant to rebel against the British. In June 1857, rebels of the 12th Bengal
            Native Infantry seized the Star Fort of Jhansi containing the treasure and magazine,[25] and after persuading
            the British to lay down their arms by promising them no harm, broke their word and massacred 40 to 60 European
            officers of the garrison along with their wives and children. The Rani's involvement in this massacre is still a
            subject of debate.[26][27] An army doctor, Thomas Lowe, wrote after the rebellion characterising her as the
            "Jezebel of India ... the young rani upon whose head rested the blood of the slain".[28]<br><br>


            The Rani of Jhansi's seal
            Four days after the massacre the sepoys left Jhansi, having obtained a large sum of money from the Rani, and
            having threatened to blow up the palace where she lived. Following this, as the only source of authority in the
            city the Rani felt obliged to assume the administration and wrote to Major Erskine, commissioner of the Saugor
            division explaining the events which had led her to do so.[29] On 2 July, Erskine wrote in reply, requesting her
            to "manage the District for the British Government" until the arrival of a British Superintendent.[30] The
            Rani's forces defeated an attempt by the mutineers to assert the claim to the throne of a rival prince Sadashiv
            Rao (nephew of Maharaja Gangadhar Rao) who was captured and imprisoned. <br><br>

            There was then an invasion of Jhansi by the forces of Company allies Orchha and Datia; their intention however
            was to divide Jhansi between themselves. The Rani appealed to the British for aid but it was now believed by the
            governor-general that she was responsible for the massacre and no reply was received. She set up a foundry to
            cast cannon to be used on the walls of the fort and assembled forces including some from former feudatories of
            Jhansi and elements of the mutineers which were able to defeat the invaders in August 1857. Her intention at
            this time was still to hold Jhansi on behalf of the British.[31]

        <h2>Bhagat Singh</h2>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagat_Singh" target="_blank"><b>Bhagat Singh</b></a> (Punjabi
            pronunciation:
            [pə̀ɡət̪ sɪ́ŋɡ] (About this soundlisten) 1907[a] – 23
            March 1931) was an
            Indian socialist revolutionary whose two acts of dramatic violence against the British in India and execution at
            age 23 made him a folk hero of the Indian independence movement.

            In December 1928, Bhagat Singh and an associate, Shivaram Rajguru, fatally shot a 21-year-old British police
            officer, John Saunders, in Lahore, Punjab, in what is today Pakistan, mistaking Saunders, who was still on
            probation, for the British police superintendent, James Scott, whom they had intended to assassinate.[5] They
            believed Scott was responsible for the death of a popular Indian nationalist leader Lala Lajpat Rai by having
            ordered a lathi charge in which Rai was injured and two weeks thereafter died of a heart attack. As Saunders
            exited a police station on a motorcycle, he was felled by a single bullet fired from across the street by
            Rajguru, a marksman.[6] As he lay injured, he was then shot at close range several times by Singh, the
            postmortem report showing eight bullet wounds.[7] Another associate of Singh, Chandra Shekhar Azad, shot dead an
            Indian police head constable, Channan Singh, who attempted to give chase to Singh and Rajguru as they
            fled.[6]
        <br>
        <br>
            After having escaped, Singh and his associates used pseudonyms to publicly announce avenging Lajpat Rai's death,
            putting up prepared posters that they altered to show Saunders as their intended target.[6] Singh was thereafter
            on the run for many months, and no convictions resulted at the time. Surfacing again in April 1929, he and
            another associate, Batukeshwar Dutt, set off two home-made bombs inside the Central Legislative Assembly in
            Delhi. They showered leaflets from the gallery on the legislators below, shouted slogans, and then allowed the
            authorities to arrest them.[8] The arrest, and the resulting publicity, brought to light Singh's complicity in
            the John Saunders case. Awaiting trial, Singh gained much public sympathy after he joined fellow defendant Jatin
            Das in a hunger strike, demanding better prison conditions for Indian prisoners, the strike ending in Das's
            death from starvation in September 1929. Singh was convicted and hanged in March 1931, aged 23.<br><br>

            Bhagat Singh became a popular folk hero after his death. Jawaharlal Nehru wrote about him: "Bhagat Singh did not
            become popular because of his act of terrorism but because he seemed to vindicate, for the moment, the honour of
            Lala Lajpat Rai, and through him of the nation. He became a symbol; the act was forgotten, the symbol remained,
            and within a few months each town and village of the Punjab, and to a lesser extent in the rest of northern
            India, resounded with his name."[9] In still later years, Singh, an atheist and socialist in life, won admirers
            in India from among a political spectrum that included both communists and right-wing Hindu nationalists.
            Although many of Singh's associates, as well as many Indian anti-colonial revolutionaries, were also involved in
            daring acts and were either executed or died violent deaths, few came to be lionised in popular art and
            literature to the same extent as Singh.
